# AS
A thingy written in C I need to save somewhere

# What is this??
uhm, its just 20 lines of C that prints ascii. Coded this for a simple project, and to make a tiktok with it.

# How to use:
I feel like if you know how to use git you can figure this out, but if your that low level, you can run it by going to your AS folder and doing: chmod +x then:  ./AS (Only if your using linux) if your using windows: just run the .exe file
